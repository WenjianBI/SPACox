\title{Fits a NULL model for SPACox}
\usage{
SPACox_Null_Model(
  formula,
  data = NULL,
  pIDs = NULL,
  gIDs = NULL,
  range = c(-100, 100),
  length.out = 10000,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula to be passed to function coxph(). For more details, please refer to package survival.}

\item{data}{a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in the formula}

\item{pIDs}{a character vector of subject IDs. NOTE: its order should be the same as the subjects order in the formula.}

\item{gIDs}{a character vector of subject IDs. NOTE: its order should be the same as the subjects order of the Geno.mtx (i.e. the input of the function SPACox()).}

\item{range}{a two-element numeric vector (default: c(-100,100)) to specify the domain of the empirical CGF.}

\item{length.out}{a positive integer (default: 9999) for empirical CGF. Larger length.out corresponds to longer calculation time and more accurate estimated empirical CGF.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to function coxph(). For more details, please refer to package survival.}
}
\value{
an object with a class of "SPACox_NULL_Model".
}
\description{
Fits a null Cox proportional hazards model and then calculates the empirical cumulant generation function (CGF) of the martingale residuals
